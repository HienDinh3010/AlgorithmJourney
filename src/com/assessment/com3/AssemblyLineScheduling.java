/**
 * In a car factory there are two assembly lines, called A and B.
 * Each of them consists of N positions numbered from 0 to N-1.
 * In each position, some component is installed into the car being assembled. The lines are symmetric;
 * that is, the same component is installed into the car in the corresponding positions of A and B.
 * In order to assemble a car, it needs to get through all of the positions on the assembly lines.
 * It takes A[K] minutes to install the component in the K-th position on line A, and B[K] minutes to install it on line B.
 * After installing a component in the K-th position, the car can either be moved to the next position on the same line
 * (which happens automatically and takes 0 minutes) or it can be moved to the other line. Switching from line A to line B takes X minutes,
 * and switching from line B to line A takes Y minutes. The assembly process can be started in either line.
 * Write a function: class Solution { public int solution (int[] A, int[] B, int X, int Y)
 * }
 * that, given arrays A and B consisting of N integers each, and integers X and Y,returns the minimum time required to assemble an entire car.
